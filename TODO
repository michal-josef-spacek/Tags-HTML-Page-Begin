====
5. Pridat xmlns atribut html elementu
6. Udelat priklady pro xhtml a html verze.
8. Could we move 'css_init' to begin of css?
One possibility is use somthing like unshift() instead of put(). But we don't
have.
Another possiblity is rewrite code to something like process_css() (create in
this module) to handle css by hand.
